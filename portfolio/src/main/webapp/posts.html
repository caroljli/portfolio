                                One of the things I look forward to every day is making food! I've always enjoyed
                                cooking, but never really made time for it during the semester. I'm glad, out of all things,
                                I was able to experiment with cooking more.

                                During the semester, I would always complain that I didn't have time to explore Philadelphia
                                enough; despite having been here for the past two years, I felt like I knew very little of
                                what the city had to offer (aside from the occassional restaurant week or food excursion,
                                to say the least).

                                <br></br>

                                Philadelphia is very different than the rainy hometown of Vancouver I lived in for over 10
                                years of my life. Its constant sunshine, early mornings and late nights, summer humidity,
                                and windy tunnels are definitely new experiences to me all-around, coming from the mild, 
                                temperate, and wet west coast that I was so familiar with. I always found it very
                                fascinating to go home to find that it was a lot darker and rainier in Vancouver than I
                                had remembered, especially in contrast with the truly always-sunny Philadelphia.

                                <br></br>

                                One of my favourite places in the city (near campus, at least) is Cira Green, as I can go
                                and see the entire skyline at once. It feels nice to be able to watch the sunset from an
                                elevated place, taking advantage of the relatively flat suburbs and otherwise lack of 
                                elevations, very unlike home. The broad, clear skies means that I can always see the stars.
                                Recently, I've also come to appreciate going to vast, open, outdoor parks like Bellmont
                                Plateau. The Schuylkill River is, however, still crowded with people, rendering it a 
                                relatively unsafe place to spend a lot of time at.

                        <h3>Things I Did that I Often Overlook &nbsp; ‚Ä¢ &nbsp;<a class="coral">May 28, 2020</a></h3>
                        <div class="box">
                            <p>
                               I think it's interesting how fast a college year can pass‚Äîneedless to say, it often feels
                               like just yesterday that it was the summer before freshmen year, and I was excited to
                               explore all sorts of ~ college novelties ~, whether that be finally moving away from home, 
                               living by myself (sort of), or meeting new (and ~ exotic ~) Americans. ;)

                               <br></br>

                               And now, living the reality of becoming an upperclassman and attempting to stomach that 
                               college is already half over (yikes), I'm wondering what it is that I actually did during 
                               the past two years. Amidst the many problem sets and late nights, spending time with 
                               people I care about definitely highlights much of my college experience so far and 
                               is something I definitely missed in the latter half of the semester altogether. Out of 
                               all things that I wish happened this semester, I wanted the second part of sophomore spring 
                               to happen, as it ended up being one of the most highly anticipated time periods of my entire 
                               college career.

                               <br></br>

                                I think the thing about college is that time seems to be condensed. Little of it is mundane, 
                                as there's always something to see or someone to meet, and you feel like you have to pack 
                                a lot of experiences together in order to meet the pressure of being "sceney" or active in 
                                your social life. Although I gave into that pressure a lot during freshmen year (a phenomenon 
                                almost directed linked to PennFace, which is basically what Penn calls duck syndrome), I think 
                                that, regardless of feeling like you have to be social, you feel bad when you quickly lose touch 
                                of friends that you made just as quickly. In a nutshell, I think quarantine has made me pretty 
                                unsocial, but I'm excited to appreciate meeting with people again (if this all ends).
