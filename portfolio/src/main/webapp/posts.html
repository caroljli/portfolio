                                cooking, but never really made time for it during the semester. I'm glad, out of all things,
                                I was able to experiment with cooking more.

                            <p>
                                During the semester, I would always complain that I didn't have time to explore Philadelphia
                                enough; despite having been here for the past two years, I felt like I knew very little of
                                what the city had to offer (aside from the occassional restaurant week or food excursion,
                                to say the least).

                                <br></br>

                                Philadelphia is very different than the rainy hometown of Vancouver I lived in for over 10
                                years of my life. Its constant sunshine, early mornings and late nights, summer humidity,
                                and windy tunnels are definitely new experiences to me all-around, coming from the mild, 
                                temperate, and wet west coast that I was so familiar with. I always found it very
                                fascinating to go home to find that it was a lot darker and rainier in Vancouver than I
                                had remembered, especially in contrast with the truly always-sunny Philadelphia.

                                <br></br>

                                One of my favourite places in the city (near campus, at least) is Cira Green, as I can go
                                and see the entire skyline at once. It feels nice to be able to watch the sunset from an
                                elevated place, taking advantage of the relatively flat suburbs and otherwise lack of 
                                elevations, very unlike home. The broad, clear skies means that I can always see the stars.
                                Recently, I've also come to appreciate going to vast, open, outdoor parks like Bellmont
                                Plateau. The Schuylkill River is, however, still crowded with people, rendering it a 
                                relatively unsafe place to spend a lot of time at.

                        <h3>Things I Did that I Often Overlook &nbsp; ‚Ä¢ &nbsp;<a class="coral">May 28, 2020</a></h3>
                        <div class="box">
                            <p>
                                I think it's interesting how fast a college year can pass‚Äîneedless to say, it often feels
                                like just yesterday that it was the summer before freshmen year, and I was excited to
                                explore all sorts of ~ college novelties ~, whether that be finally moving away from home, 
                                living by myself (sort of), or meeting new (and ~ exotic ~) Americans. ;)

                                <br></br>

                                And now, living the reality of becoming an upperclassman and attempting to stomach that 
                                college is already half over (yikes), I'm wondering what it is that I actually did during 
                                the past two years. Amidst the many problem sets and late nights, spending time with 
                                people I care about definitely highlights much of my college experience so far and 
                                is something I definitely missed in the latter half of the semester altogether. Out of 
                                all things that I wish happened this semester, I wanted the second part of sophomore spring 
                                to happen, as it ended up being one of the most highly anticipated time periods of my
                                college career.

                                <br></br>

                                Everyone characterizes sophomore slump as the reason why sophomore year is allegedly horrible,
                                sourced from the pressure of recruiting, taking difficult core classes, and other aspects sourced 
                                from a combination of curriculum and Penn pressure. During this time, it's easy to feel strong
                                bouts of imposter syndrome and inadequacy, and I found myself often thinking that I wasn't good
                                enough when a grade didn't turn out how I wanted, or I couldn't solve a problem in a problem set,
                                or I compared myself to everyone else and felt like I wasn't doing enough. As I did this, I looked
                                over the things that I was able to accomplish, the new friends I made and the new opportunities and
                                experiences I was able to have. As a consequence, I didn't know it at the time, but I was doing
                                enough; sometimes, it was just kind of hard to tell when everything seemed to be moving so fast.

                                <br></br>

                                On another note, I think something very characteristic of college is that time seems to be 
                                condensed. Little of it is mundane, as there's always something to see or someone to meet,  
                                and you feel like you have to pack a lot of experiences together in order to meet the pressure
                                of being "sceney" or active in your social life. Although I gave into that pressure a lot during 
                                freshmen year (a phenomenon almost directed linked to PennFace, which is basically what Penn 
                                calls duck syndrome), I think that, regardless of feeling like you have to be social, you 
                                feel bad when you quickly lose touch with friends that you made just as quickly. I think 
                                its hard to dissociate sometimes and just appreciate those around you.
                                
                                <br></br>

                                That said, I think being kicked off campus in the middle of spring break meade me realize that 
                                quarantine was quite the stark opposite. Without a doubt, talking to people in person will be 
                                very weird once this entire pandemic blows over, if it ever does. I'm grateful that I was still
                                able to do a lot, even though everything was virtual, as my clubs were still quite active and
                                we met regularly on Zoom.
