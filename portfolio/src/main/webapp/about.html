                                Hey! I'm glad you're here!
                                <br></br>
                                I'm Carol, a rising sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania. I'm from Vancouver, 
                                Canada, and‚Äîlike most people from Vancouver‚ÄîI'm fond of hiking, trees, eating (a lot), 
                                and cooking.
                                <br></br>
                                Although I haven't been able to go outside as much because of quarantine (cri), I'm
                                glad that I've been able to spend this time exploring more things to make, specifically
                                of different Asian cuisines. You can check out some things I've cooked here (TODO: link).
                                <br></br>
                                Aside from that, I also like to watch shows! My taste is diverse, but some shows I really
                                enjoy include Hyouka (a mystery slice-of-life anime animated by Kyoani, which is one of my
                                favourites !!), Money Heist (a Spanish thriller-drama about a heist on the Spanish Mint), 
                                How I Met Your Mother (as you do), and Boku No Hero Academia (or My Hero Academia, another
                                anime that I really like).
